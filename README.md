CS 109 Challenge: An Analysis of Larry Sabatoâ€™s Crystal Ball (November 2021)

## Purpose
This project was created as an extra credit assignment for CS109, Stanford's probability class in the Computer Science department. My goal for this project was finding the answers I desired in an efficient and correct manner, as such some of the style choices made were suboptimal.
